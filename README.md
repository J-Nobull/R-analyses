# R Data Analysis Portfolio (Master’s Coursework)

This repository contains a collection of **eight R data analysis projects**, completed while earning a  **Master’s in Data Science**.
Repository contains:
     - R scripts with the analysis workflow
     - An accompanying report (`.pdf`) with outputs and interpretation
The projects use publicly available datasets (primarily from Kaggle) and represent my **early applied work in R**, focusing on **data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis**.

## Project Summaries

1. **Consumer Demographics & Auto Dealerships**
   Explored demographic factors such as age, income, employment sector, and household size to understand consumer behavior and implications for auto dealerships.

2. **Employee Attrition Analysis**
   Tested hypotheses on employee tenure, promotions, education levels, and business travel frequency to identify drivers of attrition and work–life balance challenges.

3. **NYC Airbnb Market Analysis**
   Conducted exploratory analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City, examining host activity, geographic distribution, and pricing dynamics to identify market trends.

4. **Student Absences & Social Factors**
   Investigated whether romantic relationships influence student absences in math classes, with implications for education policy and student engagement strategies.

5. **Graduate Admissions I – Predictive Factors**
   Analyzed the impact of GRE scores, TOEFL scores, GPA, research experience, and recommendations on graduate admissions outcomes using regression models.

6. **Healthcare, Income, & Mortality in U.S. Cities**
   Modeled the direct and indirect effects of income and healthcare availability on mortality rates in small American cities using multivariate regression.

7. **Graduate Admissions II – Model Comparison**
   Extended the admissions analysis by comparing multiple regression models, evaluating GPA, research, SOP, and LOR strength as predictors of admission chances.

8. **Advertising Spend & Revenue Dynamics**
   Examined the relationship between advertising investment and revenue growth for two fictional companies, applying correlation and regression to guide budget strategy.

## Tech Stack

These projects were implemented in **R** using the following core packages and tools:

* **Data manipulation**: `dplyr`, `tidyr`
* **Visualization**: `ggplot2`, `lattice`
* **Statistical modeling**: `stats`, `car`, `MASS`
* **Regression & classification**: `caret`, `lm`, `glm`
* **Data input/output**: `readr`, `readxl`
* **Reporting**: `knitr`, `rmarkdown`

---
## Skills Demonstrated

* **Data cleaning & preprocessing** (handling missing data, feature transformation)
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with `ggplot2` and base R plotting
* **Statistical modeling** (linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing)
* **Regression model comparison & interpretation**
* **Reproducible analysis** with organized scripts and documented reports

---
## How to Use

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/R-analyses.git
   ```
2. Open any `.R` file in RStudio (or another R IDE).
3. Run the script to reproduce the analysis (datasets may need to be downloaded separately if not included).
4. Alternatively, view the corresponding `.pdf` report for results and interpretation.

## Notes
* These analyses were my **first applied projects in R**, forming the foundation for more advanced work in data science.
* The datasets used are **publicly available**, mainly from **Kaggle**.
* Each report highlights **both the code and the reasoning** behind the results.

## Next Steps

I now apply more advanced methods in **machine learning, deep learning, and applied business analytics** using both R and Python. This repo remains a portfolio snapshot of my **early journey in data science with R**.
